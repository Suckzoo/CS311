[File Description]
cs311.c ----------- This contains main function.
                    It uploads instruction and data into memory regions, and parse and execute them by using functions which will be implemented by you.

util.c & util.h --- This contains all the data structures.
                    This also contains several useful functions. (Read and write data into the memory region, initialize the memory region and etc...)

parse.c & parse.h - This contains variables and functions to parse the instruction and data.
                    You should implement them.

run.c & run.h ----- This contains variables and functions to execute instructions.
                    You should implement them.

sample_input ------ This directory contains serveral sample input files.
                    Please use these files for your program testing.

[Compile & Execution]
Just type "make" to compile your code.
You can execute your program using this command: ./cs311em [-m addr1:addr2] [-d] [-n num_instr] inputBinary
	* -m : Dump the memory content form addr1 to addr2
	* -d : Print the register file content for each instruction execution. Print memory content too if -m option is enabled.
	* -n : Number of instructions to execute. Default value is 100.

In each file, we write some comments to help you to understand the code, so please read them carefully. :D
If you have any question, please email us. (cs311_ta@calab.kaist.ac.kr)
